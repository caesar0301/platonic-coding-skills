## Overview

**Platonic Coding** is a coding style designed for complex projects and cross-team collaboration with AI agents. Instead of relying on prompts, vibes, or implicit assumptions, it treats specifications as abstract laws that define what can exist, what can change, and what must always hold. Agents operate inside a shared, closed spec world where meaning is explicit, violations are detectable, and evolution is traceable over time, making large systems reproducible, reviewable, and stable across teams, agents, and long development cycles.

## In Practice

### 🚀 Grism: Hypergraph Database in 3 Days

We built [**Grism**](https://github.com/mirasoth/Grism), an AI-native, neurosymbolic hypergraph database, from concept to *working prototype* in just **three days** using the Platonic Coding method.

Grism features:
- **Hypergraph-first architecture** with n-ary relations as the core primitive
- **Multi-layered engine** (Python API → Logical Plan → Optimizer → Storage)
- **Neurosymbolic integration** for combining symbolic reasoning with neural signals
- **Comprehensive RFC specifications** driving all design decisions

By defining the system's form through RFCs before writing code, agents operated within a closed, legally defined space. Every architectural decision was traceable, every component was spec-compliant, and the entire codebase remained coherent across rapid iteration cycles.

*This demonstrates that Platonic Coding doesn't slow you down, it accelerates complex system development by eliminating ambiguity and drift.*

## General Workflow

Platonic Coding follows a **five-phase, closed-world workflow**. Meaning is progressively *constrained*, *materialized*, and *verified* as the system moves from abstract intent to concrete code.

## Examples

Examples are ordered by the general workflow: specs → impl guide → code (manual) → review. Each shows a single skill in action.

### Example 1: Create design specs (Phase 1)

```
I'm starting a new project called "AI Assistant Platform".
Use the platonic-code-specs skill to initialize the
specification system in docs/specs/
```

**Result:** RFC specification system with standard, history, index, and namings files.

### Example 2: Create implementation guide (Phase 2)

```
Use the platonic-impl-guide skill to create an implementation guide for
RFC-001 (Authentication) targeting the auth module. Use TypeScript and
the existing Express patterns in this repo.
```

**Result:** Implementation guide with module structure, types, interfaces, and implementation details aligned with the RFC.

### Example 3: Implement from guide (Phase 3)

```
Implement the user authentication feature following docs/impl/rfc-001-auth-impl.md
and docs/specs/rfc-001-authentication.md. Do not deviate from the spec or the guide.
```

**Result:** Code that matches the implementation guide and the RFC (no separate skill; the agent uses the docs as source of truth).

### Example 4: Review code against spec (Phase 4)

```
Use the platonic-code-review skill to verify that src/auth/
correctly implements all requirements from docs/specs/rfc-001-authentication.md.
```

**Result:** Compliance report showing what is implemented, what is missing, and what is inconsistent.

### Example 5: Maintain specifications

```
Use the platonic-code-specs skill to refine all specifications in docs/specs/,
check consistency, and regenerate history, index, and namings.
```

**Result:** Validated specifications with updated history, index, and terminology files.

### Example 6: Gap analysis

```
Use the platonic-code-review skill to identify gaps between
all RFCs in docs/specs/ and the implementation in src/.
```

**Result:** Bi-directional analysis of unimplemented specs and undocumented code.

### Example 7: Validate implementation guide

```
Use the platonic-impl-guide skill to validate that docs/impl/rfc-001-auth-impl.md
does not contradict docs/specs/rfc-001-authentication.md.
```

**Result:** Validation report confirming the guide is spec-compliant or listing contradictions to fix.
