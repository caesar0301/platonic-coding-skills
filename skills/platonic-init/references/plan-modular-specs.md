# Plan Modular Specs

From scan results, propose a modular RFC dependency graph with a bounded number of specs.

## Objective

Design a small, focused graph of Draft RFCs that captures the existing system's design. The user MUST confirm this plan before any specs are generated.

## Inputs

| Input | Source |
|-------|--------|
| Scan synthesis | From scan-project.md Phase 5 |
| Max RFC count | Default: 5. User may override |
| RFC numbering start | Default: 0001. User may override |

## Modular Planning Principles

### Principle 1: One System-Wide Conceptual Design

Always produce **exactly 1** Conceptual Design spec:

- RFC-0001 (or user-specified start number)
- Covers the entire system's vision, principles, taxonomy, and invariants
- Every other RFC depends on this one

### Principle 2: One Architecture Spec Per Major Subsystem

For each major subsystem identified in the scan:

- Create a separate Architecture Design RFC
- Each depends on the Conceptual Design RFC
- Each covers a cohesive set of modules with clear boundaries

### Principle 3: Impl Interface Specs Only on Request

Do NOT plan Implementation Interface Design specs unless the user explicitly asks for them. If requested:

- Create one per major API boundary surface
- Each depends on relevant Architecture Design RFCs

### Principle 4: Bounded Count

Stay within the max RFC count (default: 5):

- If there are more subsystems than the count allows, **merge** related subsystems into a single Architecture spec
- Prefer fewer, richer specs over many thin ones
- The conceptual design always counts as 1 of the total

### Principle 5: Meaningful Granularity

Do not create architecture specs that are too broad or too narrow:

- **Too broad**: One architecture spec covering the entire system (that's what conceptual is for)
- **Too narrow**: One per source file or small module
- **Right size**: One per major subsystem with 2+ modules and distinct responsibility

## Subsystem Identification Heuristic

From the scan's structural analysis:

1. **Top-level packages/crates/modules** with distinct names and responsibilities are subsystem candidates
2. **Cluster related modules**: If several small modules serve the same purpose (e.g., `utils/`, `helpers/`, `common/`), merge them
3. **Respect dependency direction**: Modules in the same layer that depend on each other are often one subsystem
4. **Simple projects** (1-3 modules): May produce only 1 architecture spec
5. **Complex projects** (10+ modules): Group into 3-4 subsystems max

## Output Format

Present the proposed RFC graph to the user as a table and dependency diagram:

### Table Format

```markdown
| RFC | Title | Kind | Summary | Depends On |
|-----|-------|------|---------|------------|
| RFC-0001 | [System] Vision and Principles | Conceptual | System goals, core principles, taxonomy | — |
| RFC-0002 | [Subsystem A] Architecture | Architecture | Components, data flow, constraints for A | RFC-0001 |
| RFC-0003 | [Subsystem B] Architecture | Architecture | Components, data flow, constraints for B | RFC-0001 |
```

### Dependency Diagram

```
RFC-0001 (Conceptual: System Vision)
├── RFC-0002 (Architecture: Subsystem A)
└── RFC-0003 (Architecture: Subsystem B)
```

### Confirmation Prompt

After presenting the plan, ask:

> "Here is the proposed RFC structure for your project. Before I generate the specs:
> 1. Should any subsystems be merged or split?
> 2. Should any RFC titles be adjusted?
> 3. Would you like to add Implementation Interface Design specs?
> 4. Should the total count change?
>
> Confirm to proceed, or suggest adjustments."

## Adjustment Rules

If the user wants changes:

- **Merge**: Combine two architecture RFCs into one covering both subsystems
- **Split**: Break one architecture RFC into two (if count allows)
- **Add impl interface**: Add Implementation Interface Design RFCs (increases count)
- **Rename**: Update RFC titles
- **Reorder**: Change RFC numbering
- **Change count**: Increase or decrease the max

After adjustments, re-present the updated plan for confirmation.

## Examples

### Small Project (1-2 modules)

```
| RFC | Title | Kind |
|-----|-------|------|
| RFC-0001 | System Vision and Principles | Conceptual |
| RFC-0002 | System Architecture | Architecture |
```

Total: 2 RFCs.

### Medium Project (3-6 modules)

```
| RFC | Title | Kind |
|-----|-------|------|
| RFC-0001 | System Vision and Principles | Conceptual |
| RFC-0002 | Core Engine Architecture | Architecture |
| RFC-0003 | API Layer Architecture | Architecture |
| RFC-0004 | Storage Layer Architecture | Architecture |
```

Total: 4 RFCs.

### Large Project (10+ modules)

```
| RFC | Title | Kind |
|-----|-------|------|
| RFC-0001 | System Vision and Principles | Conceptual |
| RFC-0002 | Core Domain Architecture | Architecture |
| RFC-0003 | Service Layer Architecture | Architecture |
| RFC-0004 | Infrastructure Architecture | Architecture |
| RFC-0005 | API and Integration Architecture | Architecture |
```

Total: 5 RFCs (at default max).

## Notes

- The plan is a proposal, not a commitment. The user has full control.
- RFC numbers assigned during planning may change if user adjusts.
- Recovery proceeds in order: conceptual first, then architecture (by RFC number).
- After generation, rfc-index.md, rfc-namings.md, and rfc-history.md are updated to reflect all generated specs.
