# Platonic Init

Initialize the **Platonic Coding** system for any project -- greenfield or existing codebase.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when you need to:

- **Bootstrap** a new project with the Platonic Coding infrastructure
- **Adopt** the Platonic Coding paradigm for an existing codebase
- **Recover** missing design specs from code that was built without formal specifications
- **Set up** `.platonic.yml` config, specs directory, templates, and impl guide scaffolding

Keywords: init, bootstrap, setup, adopt, recover, specs, RFC, platonic coding, project setup

## What This Skill Does

This skill operates in one of two modes:

### Mode 1: Greenfield Init (no existing code)

Scaffolds the Platonic Coding infrastructure only:

- `.platonic.yml` project config at project root
- `specs/` directory with RFC infrastructure and templates
- `docs/impl/` directory for implementation guides
- `docs/drafts/` directory for Phase 0 design drafts

### Mode 2: Recovery Init (existing codebase)

Scaffolds infrastructure **and** recovers design specs from the existing code:

1. Scaffold directories, config, and templates
2. Scan the codebase systematically (5 phases)
3. Plan a modular RFC dependency graph (present to user for confirmation)
4. Generate Draft RFCs capturing the system's conceptual and architecture design
5. Populate rfc-index.md, rfc-namings.md, and rfc-history.md

## Core Concepts

### Three Spec Kinds

Platonic Coding recognizes three kinds of RFC specifications:

| Kind | Purpose | Contains | Does NOT Contain |
|------|---------|----------|------------------|
| **Conceptual Design** | Vision, principles, taxonomy, invariants | Design philosophy, abstractions, terminology | Schemas, APIs, code |
| **Architecture Design** | Components, layers, data flow, constraints | Module responsibilities, dependency rules, abstract schemas | Concrete API signatures, language-specific code |
| **Impl Interface Design** | API contracts, naming conventions, signatures | Type definitions, interface contracts, error patterns | Implementation details, algorithms |

### Modular RFC Recovery

Recovery produces a **small graph of focused RFCs** (default maximum: 5), not monolithic documents:

- **Exactly 1** system-wide Conceptual Design spec (RFC-0001)
- **1 per major subsystem** Architecture Design spec (depends on RFC-0001)
- **Impl Interface specs** only on explicit user request

The agent MUST present the proposed RFC graph to the user before generating any specs.

## Available Operations

| Operation | Reference File | Purpose |
|-----------|----------------|---------|
| **Scaffold** | `scaffold-project.md` | Create directories, config, templates |
| **Scan** | `scan-project.md` | Systematically analyze existing codebase |
| **Plan Modular Specs** | `plan-modular-specs.md` | Propose RFC dependency graph from scan results |
| **Recover Conceptual** | `recover-conceptual.md` | Generate conceptual design spec from code |
| **Recover Architecture** | `recover-architecture.md` | Generate architecture design spec from code |
| **Recover Impl Interface** | `recover-impl-interface.md` | Generate impl interface design spec from code |

See [references/REFERENCE.md](references/REFERENCE.md) for detailed operation guides.

## Output Structure

```
<project-root>/
├── .platonic.yml                   # Project config (auto-discovered by all platonic skills)

## Templates

Templates are provided in `assets/` for all generated files:

- `platonic.yml.template` - Project configuration
- `rfc-standard.md.template` - RFC process with spec kinds guidance
- `rfc-history.md.template`, `rfc-index.md.template`, `rfc-namings.md.template` - Infrastructure
- `rfc-template.md` - Generic RFC template
- `conceptual-design.md.template` - Conceptual design spec template
- `architecture-design.md.template` - Architecture design spec template
- `impl-interface-design.md.template` - Implementation interface design spec template
- `impl-guide-template.md` - Implementation guide template
- `impl-readme.md.template`, `drafts-readme.md.template` - Directory READMEs

Templates use `{{PLACEHOLDER}}` syntax. Common placeholders: `{{PROJECT_NAME}}`, `{{LANGUAGE}}`, `{{FRAMEWORK}}`.

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Initialize a New Project

```
Use platonic-init to set up Platonic Coding for my new project "Acme".
Language is TypeScript, framework is Next.js. Specs go in specs/.
```

### Example 2: Adopt Platonic Coding for Existing Code

```
Use platonic-init to recover design specs for this existing project.
Scan the codebase and propose what RFCs to generate.
```

### Example 3: Recovery with Custom Paths

```
Use platonic-init in recovery mode. Put specs in docs/rfcs/
and impl guides in docs/design/. Generate up to 4 RFCs.
```

## Best Practices

1. **Always read the reference file** for each operation before executing it
2. **Review recovered specs**: All generated RFCs are Draft -- review and refine with platonic-specs
3. **Confirm the RFC graph**: The agent proposes a modular spec plan; confirm before generation
4. **Keep it small**: Fewer, focused specs are better than many overlapping ones
5. **Use platonic-workflow** for future development after initialization

## Dependencies

- Read/write access to project directories
- Markdown file support
- For recovery mode: ability to scan and read source code files

## Integration with Other Skills

- **platonic-specs**: Use `refine` operation post-init to validate and update recovered specs
- **platonic-workflow**: After init, start at Phase 2 (impl guide) for new features
- **platonic-impl-guide**: Create implementation guides from recovered RFC specs
- **platonic-code-review**: Review code against recovered specs
